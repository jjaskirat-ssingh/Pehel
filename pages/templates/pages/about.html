                We at Pehel are connecting the people who want to do charity with people in need.We believe that helping hands are better than praying lips.Even a small donation of yours can make a difference.
                <br>
                Some of the things which people can donate are clothes and books.We work in collaboration with different NGOs. We collect donations from people and provide it to the NGOs. Currently,we are working in Patiala only,but we are expecting to expand our cause to further parts of country also.
